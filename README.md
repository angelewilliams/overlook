# Overlook Hotel

 Overlook Hotel is a booking application allowing users to login to the hotel's website, view their bookings, view rooms available upon selecting a date, and book a new reservation all in one user interface.

This was the final project of the second module of the front-end Engineering program at Turing School of Software and Design. The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/overlook.html).
